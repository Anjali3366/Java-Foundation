// Statment -- We are given a String S , we need to find the cunt of all contiguous substrings Starting and ending with the same character. 
// Example  S= "abcab" output = 7;

// There are 15 substrings of "abcab" : a, ab, abc, abca, abcab, b, bc, bca, bcab, c, ca, cab, a, ab, b Out of the above substrings,there are 7 substrings :a, abca, b, bcab, c, a and b. So,only 7 contiguous substrings start and end with the same character
